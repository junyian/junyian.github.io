## Reboot

My PC crashed some time ago, and I had to reinstall everything. At the same,
work load just gotten a lot heavier for the past 2 years so I never found
the time to properly set up my workstation again.

I was also kind-of lazy to set up Jekyll again, and started to look for
alternatives. Then I was introduced to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which seemed
like it didn't require as much maintenance as Jekyll.

So, this is the reboot of my blog. I'll slowly port over the posts I've created
before in the previous blog, and add on my write ups for the more recent 
[Flare-On](https://flare-on.com) challenges. Might as well take this opportunity
to review my previous posts and fix the scripts that's no longer working too,
while learning how to use Hugo and this template.
