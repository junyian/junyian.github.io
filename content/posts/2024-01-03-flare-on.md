[Flare-On][flareon] is a CTF[^1]-style reverse engineering challenge. This has
been held annually since 2014, though I only discovered it in 2021. There are
multiple levels, each one harder than the next. Solving the challenges require
a wide knowledge across multiple disciplines. And there is typically more than
one way to solve the challenges, depending on one's creativity.

This post aims to be an index page to my (sub-par) solutions for the completed
Flare-on challenges. The binaries to the challenges can be downloaded from their
[website][flareon].
