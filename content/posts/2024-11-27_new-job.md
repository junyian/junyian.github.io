I started a new role about 3 months ago... after 6 months of unemployment. So far,
the role itself is quite interesting. For starters, I'm finally moving out from doing
telecoms-related work, although the company is a telecoms provider. But I get to
do stuff that's more related to product/solutions development. And I get to dip
my hands into cybersecurity space. Unfortunately, this role comes with a huge
pay cut - about 80%. But it's better than nothing, given the current job market.
I definitely have a very long way to go if I want to regain my desired salary.
We shall see what the future holds.
