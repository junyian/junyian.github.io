The last month of 2023 was one hell of a ride. Many things happened all at once.

For starters, I was laid off from my role which I held for almost 9 years. So
I've been a little out of it, reflecting on what I would like to do next. I've
been in the telecoms industry for about 20 years. Mainly focused on mobile
networks rollout and optimization since 3G (WCDMA) days. But now I'm thinking
of moving out of the industry and try something new. Cybersecurity, maybe? I  
have a lot of catching up to do though, since I've only treated reverse
engineering as a hobby and never really followed the cybersecurity industry trends.

And then I caught the dengue fever, which landed me in hospital for 2 nights.
But I was practically bedridden for an entire week, and also extremely lethargic
for another week. That really put a big blow in my holiday plans to prepare myself
for potentially moving into cybersecurity space.

But I hope with the new year, things will get better. I have till end of the month
for my employment term, then I'll be officially jobless - unless I land a new role
before then. But job prospects look really grim.
