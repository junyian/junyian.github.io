## Introduction

Following the same writing style as [Flare-On 2014 Challenge 1][f01c01], in
which I will attempt to explain my thought process in tackling this challenge.
With this, I hope this will benefit absolute beginners to reverse engineering.

## Recon

[Detect-It-Easy (DIE)][die] shows that this is a PE32 console application.
Unlike Flare-On 2014 Challenge 1, DIE doesn't give any hints of what type of
compiler is used. So we can most likely use any favourite x86 disassembler.

There are also a few interesting-looking strings that gives a clue on where to
start digging from:

```text
Offset (hex): String
00000508:     Enter the password>
0000051c:     You are success
0000052e:     You are failure
```

## Environment

Pretty straightforward so far. I'm able to run the EXE on my Windows 10 VM. If
we run the EXE, we get that prompt asking for the password. By entering some
random text we get the error message.

There are multiple approaches to begin reversing this. The obvious ones are:

1. Find the password prompt, then trace from there to see how the 'success'
   message can be triggered.
2. Find the 'success' message, then back track from there.

For this, we can use a x86 disassembler. There are multiple choices available
that works on multiple platforms (still actively developed at time of writing)

1. Open source:
   - [Ghidra][ghidra]
   - [radare2][radare2]
2. Freeware:
   - [IDA Freeware][idafree]
   - [JEB Community Edition][jebce]
3. Paid:
   - [IDA Pro][idapro] - the most popular disassembler in the industry
   - [Binary Ninja][binja]
   - [JEB Pro][jebpro]

Being a hobbyist reverse engineer, I can't afford to pay for any of the Pro
disassemblers. My personal favourite is IDA Freeware. So let's start with this
first, and I may cover other disassemblers using this challenge in the future.

## Reversing

Load the EXE into IDA, using all the default values and clicking on OK on all
prompts. Eventually we'll get to a screen with a graph and ASM code.

At a glance, this is very straightforward. If you're totally new to this, I
strongly suggest to stop here, get an x86 ASM reference, learn Windows APIs,
then come back to this. Learning from [FASM][fasm] is a good start.

Basically, the graph can be summarised as:

```text
Prompt password using WriteFile
Get input password using ReadFile
XOR each password byte with 7Dh
Check if length is 18h
Compare result to byte array at byte_402140
If equal:
    Print success
Else:
    Print failure
```

We can deduce that the flag should be related to the byte array located at
`byte_402140`, which is `18h` or 24 bytes long.

![byte_402140](./flareon2015c01_img03.PNG)

To decode the byte array, we should XOR each byte with 0x7D (the 'key').

How to XOR? There are many ways.

1. Use Windows calculator (I'm just trolling, but yeah, it is a valid option
   to calculate the XOR result byte-by-byte)

2. Write a program/script.
   I have an example Python and IDC script in [Github](https://github.com/junyian/flare-on-2015/tree/main/c01).

3. Use [Cyberchef][cyberchef]

The flag is **`bunny_sl0pe@flare-on.com`**.

## Extras

### Qiling

I've been experimenting with [Qiling Framework][qiling] to emulate the binary
and perform the following actions:

1. Hook the ReadFile API call
2. Read the encoded bytes from `byte_402140`
3. XOR the encoded bytes with 0x7D
4. Write the results into the buffer specified by ReadFile.
   The Qiling code can also be found in my [Github](https://github.com/junyian/flare-on-2015/tree/main/c01).
