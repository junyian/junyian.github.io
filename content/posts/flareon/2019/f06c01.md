## Introduction

The challenge file `MemeCatBattleStation.exe` is a .NET application. This fact
is stated in the challenge message, and even suggested to use dnSpy. But we'll
be using [dnSpyEx][dnspyex] instead to decompile the binary.

## Environment

I just started trying Windows 11. Quite surprisingly, the challenge EXE didn't
prompt to install .NET framework.

## Reversing

The initial window of the challenge have 2 key features: the text box and a
a button with the label 'Fire!'. We know from the challenge message that we are
supposed to find out the 'weapons codes'. So the immediate task is to find the
form that displays this window, and the procedures that runs after the 'Fire!'
button is clicked.

Using dnSpyEx, the form `Stage1Form` can be found very easily. Within the form,
the procedure `FireButton_Click()` is the obvious suspect to look into. And
within that procedure, it's clear that the inputs of the `codeTextBox` is
compared to the string `RAINBOW`. By using this string as the input, the next
stage form is visible.

The next stage form is pretty similar to the first one. From the dnSpyEx's
decompiler output, the `Stage2Form` is a bit more complicated than the previous
form. The procedure `FireButton_Click()` calls the function `isValidWeaponCode`
to validate the input weapon code. In `isValidWeaponCode`, the function takes
each character of the input, XORs with char `A`, then compares the result to
a sequence of arrays.

To find out the valid input string for this form, we only need to reverse the
procedure. That is, to XOR the sequence of arrays with `A`. Below is the
procedure in [Python][f19c01gh].

```python
bytes = "\x03 &$-\x1e\x02 //./"

o = ""
for c in bytes:
    o += chr(ord(c) ^ ord('A'))
print(o)
```

The code above gives the output `Bagel_Cannon`. After entering this string into
the form, a new screen is shown with the flag **`Kitteh_save_galixy@flare-on.com`**.
