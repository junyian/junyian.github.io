## Introduction

Following the same writing style as [Flare-On 2014 Challenge 1][f01c01], in
which I will attempt to explain my thought process in tackling this challenge.
With this, I hope this will benefit absolute beginners to reverse engineering.

## Recon

The challenge is a single file `login.html`, containing a text box for entering
the flag, and a button that triggers checking of the flag.

By viewing the source code, we can see:

1. The text input with ID `flag`
2. The button input with ID `prompt`

## Environment

No special environment needed. Any Chromium-based web browser with the built-in
dev tools will do.

## Reversing

Within the `<script>` tag, we can see the following actions being done:

1. Upon clicking on button `prompt`, perform the following steps.
2. Get value of `flag`.
3. Performs a function that uses `flag`, storing the result into `rotFlag`.
4. Compares `rotFlag` to the value `PyvragFvqrYbtvafNerRnfl@syner-ba.pbz`.
5. Triggers alert `Correct flag!` if equal, else trigger `Incorrect flag, rot
again`.

The function at Step 3 is of interest.

### rotFlag

Here's the function after a simple reformatting exercise.

```javascript
var rotFlag = flag.replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function (c) {
  return String.fromCharCode(
    (c <= "Z" ? 90 : 122) >= (c = c.charCodeAt(0) + 13) ? c : c - 26,
  );
});
```

It will be the reader's exercise to understand the code in detail. Basically
this is taking every alphabet in the input string and add value 13. Effectively
performing a very basic string encryption called ROT13. We can use
[Cyberchef][cyberchef] to perform the ROT13 algorithm on the value being
compared to, and get the flag **`ClientSideLoginsAreEasy@flare-on.com`**.

## Extras

### Coding practice

[Github repo][f17c01gh] containing Python3-based ROT13 decoder. From searching
around, it seems that the easiest way to implement the ROT13 is by using
Python's string translation. Quite unlike the challenge's method of adding 13
to the char value.
