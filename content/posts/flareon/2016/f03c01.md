## Introduction

Following the same writing style as [Flare-On 2014 Challenge 1][f01c01], in
which I will attempt to explain my thought process in tackling this challenge.
With this, I hope this will benefit absolute beginners to reverse engineering.

So far, this is the harder Level 1 challenge compared to the previous ones. So
this write-up will be longer than usual.

## Recon

Just like [Flare-On 2015 Challenge 1][f02c01], [Detect-It-Easy (DIE)][die] shows
that this is a PE32 console compiled using Microsoft Visual C/C++. In this case,
I choose to use [IDA Freeware][idafree] and [Ghidra][ghidra] to disassemble the
binary.

> Being a hobbyist reverse engineer, I'm a bit unwilling to buy an IDA Pro

> the amazing decompiler from Ghidra.

There are also a few interesting-looking strings that gives a clue on where to
start digging from:

```text
Offset (hex): String
0000bf98:     Enter password:
0000bfac:     Correct!
0000bfb8:     Wrong password
```

## Environment

Just like the previous year's Challenge 1, I can run the EXE on my Windows 10
VM, and getting that prompt asking for the password.

The approach I took is the same as the previous year's Challenge 1 too. But this
time I utilized Ghidra for the signature library and decompiler.

## Reversing

Following the same flow as the previous challenge, we would want to find answers
to these questions:

1. Where is our input is read?
2. How is the input used to decide 'Correct' or 'Wrong'?

We begin by loading the EXE into IDA, and we get to a screen with a graph and
ASM code.

![ida](./flareon2016c01_img01.PNG)

We can see a stark difference compared to the previous year's Challenge 1. At
first glance, the disassembly doesn't seem to make any sense. This is due to the
compiler being used. What we're seeing here is a compiler stub inserted to the
binary prior to executing `int main()`.

We could try to follow this code flow, and eventually end up at the code that
prints "Enter password:". But this is relatively more time consuming. So let's
try a quicker method to get to the code that reads the input.

## Find the code

The first thing we need to do is find where in the EXE it prints the string
"Enter password:" and read our input. There are 2 common approaches of doing
this:

1. Find the string 'Enter password:', then investigate the cross-references (or
   Xref for short) to this string.
2. Find the API that print strings to console, then investigate the Xrefs to
   it.

Since this write-up is meant for absolute beginners, I will try to explain both
methods.

## Method 1: Find the string

We know that the EXE prints "Enter password:", then wait for our prompt. And we
also know from the recon session that this string is found at offset `0000bf98`.
However, this offset refers to the physical location of the string in the EXE
file. In IDA (and all other disassemblers/debuggers), the virtual address (VA)
is used.

So let's find the VA of the string. First, bring up the Strings subview
(Shift-F12) in IDA and find the string "Enter password:".

![string](./flareon2016c01_img02.PNG)

We can see that the string is located at `40d198`. Double-click or press Enter
on the string will bring you to the disassembly window where the string is.

![string2](./flareon2016c01_img03.PNG)

IDA has automatically named the string with the label `aEnterPassword`. IDA also
shows the one-and-only Xref to this string, which is at `sub_401420+2E`. We can
double-click (or press Enter) and we'll get to the disassembly where this string
is used.

![string3](./flareon2016c01_img04.PNG)

And here we can see the familiar procedure of using `WriteFile` to print the
prompt, and `ReadFile` to get the password input. This is where we should begin
our code analysis.

## Method 2: Find the API

From Flare-On 2015 Challenge 1, we have seen that we can use `WriteFile` to
print text to console. This is what we will use to find the code for analysis.

In IDA, use the Imports subview and find the API `WriteFile`. Similar to the
previous method, double-click/Enter on the API to view the disassembly where
references to `WriteFile` can be found.

![api](./flareon2016c01_img05.PNG)

In this case, we can see there are more than 1 reference to `WriteFile`. Which
makes sense because `WriteFile` is also used to print the success/error message
too. If you put the cursor over the `WriteFile` text and press X (or right-click
then choose _Jump to xref to operand_), we get a table where this API is
referenced from.

It's a bit painful, but the supposed next step is to click on each Xref
one-by-one, quickly evaluate the code, and decide if the code is what we're
looking for. Thankfully, the first few Xrefs is what we need.

## Analysis

The procedure here is very similar to Flare-On 2015 Challenge 1, with some
slight differences.

Now, this is where Ghidra shines over IDA Freeware. We could repeat the methods
mentioned above in Ghidra and arrive at the same location in the EXE. But now
we can see the decompiled C code. And as a bonus, function `sub_402C30` seen in
IDA is identified as `_strcmp` in Ghidra.

![ghidra](./flareon2016c01_img06.PNG)

> TIP: Try renaming `sub_402C30` in IDA to `_strcmp` (with the underscore).

From this, we can see that the EXE performs these steps:

1. Takes the input
2. Pass the input to `sub_401260`
3. Compare its output to "x2dtJEOmyjacxDemx2eczT5cVS9fVUGvWTuZWjuexjRqy24rV29q"

So the function that we need to understand is at `sub_401260`.

## Understanding sub_401260

With experience, one could tell that the string being compared to looks like a
base64 encoded string. We can test that theory quite easily, by using
[Cyberchef][cyberchef] and the function "From Base64".

> It's a good idea to try understand how Base64 encoding/decoding algorithm works.

![base64decode](./flareon2016c01_img07.PNG)

Oops, the output looks like gibberish. Not quite what we expected. So now we
should investigate `sub_401260` more deeply.

By going into the function's disassembly, a quick glance around the function
shows a few references to the string "ZYXABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWzyxabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw0123456789+/"
being used as a lookup. If you already know how Base64 works, the lookup string
that's normally used is different. In other words, this Base64 algorithm is
modified.

Thankfully, Cyberchef have the feature to change the lookup string.

![base64decode2](./flareon2016c01_img08.PNG)

And by doing so, we get the flag **`sh00ting_phish_in_a_barrel@flare-on.com`**.

## Extras

### Coding practice

[Github repo][f16c01gh] containing Python3-based solutions.

1. **c01.py** - Decode the encoded string.
2. **c01_qiling.py** - Qiling script. Derives the flag on the fly and pass into
   hooked `ReadFile` to get the 'Correct!' string printed to console.

### Finding `main()`

The stub inserted by the compiler sort-of prepares the EXE before it reaches the
very important `int main()`, which is the starting function for any C/C++
program. If we refer to [this link][main], the full, Microsoft-specific
definition of `main` for a console app is:

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]);
int wmain(int argc, wchar_t* argv[], wchar_t* envp[]);
```

In IDA, we can set the rename `sub_401420` to `main`, and set the function
definition following the example above (ensure cursor is in the function, and
use keyboard shortcut Y).

![main](./flareon2016c01_img09.PNG)

We can see how `main` is called. Put the cursor on the function name, view the
Xref (shorcut key X), and navigate to the only Xref available there, which is
`start-82`. Microsoft typically uses the cdecl calling convention, which means
that the function arguments are pushed into the stack in reverse order. Hence
we can observe in the disassembly the argument `envp` is pushed first, followed
by `argv`, then `argc`, before `main` is called.
