## Introduction

The challenge file `fidler.exe` is a Python application. This challenge is
rather unique as the Python source code is also provided with the challenge. The
challenge message simply states that we should win the game by any means
necessary to get the flag.

## Environment

Of course, Python need to be installed. I installed Python 3.10.2 on Windows 11.
The following image shows the first screen upon running the challenge.

## Reversing

### Stage 1

In the prompted screen, we can see only a single text input asking for a
password. So, let's see how this password is validated. Since the source code
`fidler.py` is provided, we can immediately start to look at its contents. Very
quickly the function `password_check` can be found.

This function is very straightforward. Simply taking every character of the
string `hiptu` and subtracting 1. The result compared to an input string. With
a Python console, this is trivial to replicate to obtain the Stage 1 key
`ghost`.

```python
altered_key = 'hiptu'
key = ''.join([chr(ord(x) - 1) for x in altered_key])
print(key)
```

### Stage 2

In the next stage, we see the following window.

The easy way, albeit slow, is to follow the instructions and earn 100 billion
coins by clicking on the cat, purchasing the autoclicker and increasing the rate
of coins earned till the goal is achieved.

Eventually, the flag **`idle_with_kitty@flare-on.com`** is shown.

## Bonus

This is a reversing challenge, so why should we settle for the final flag just
like that? :) Let's try to understand what's happening behind the scenes of
Stage 2.

By browsing the source Python source code again, it's easy to spot the check for
coins on line 147.

![c04](./flareon2020c01_img04.png)

The game checks if the current coins available is `(2**36) + (2**35)`, which
turns out to be 103079215104. This number is divided by `10**8`, ending up with
`1030` after taking only the integer portion of the result. This number is used
as an argument to the function call `victory_screen`.

> The `**` in Python means power of. I.e. 2\*\*36 is 2^36.

In function `victory_screen`, the argument variable name is `token`, and is
subsequently used by the function `decode_flag`.

![c05](./flareon2020c01_img05.png)

Replicating this function in Python and using the token value `1030` returns the
same flag.
