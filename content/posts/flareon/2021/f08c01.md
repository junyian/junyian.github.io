## Introduction

The challenge is called _credchecker_ and consists of a HTML file `admin.html`
with some images. This challenge is special to me as it's the first official
Flare-On challenge that I joined, and managed to complete.

## Environment

Only a browser is sufficient. The newer Microsoft Edge is used here, which is
based on Chromium. When opening the file `admin.html`, we're greeted with the
following page.

## Reversing

The page requires 2 inputs: a username and a password. Using the browser's
developer mode, or viewing the source code, what we need to find is the HTML
form that takes the 2 inputs. We observe that the **Check Credentials** button
is grayed out, until both username and password have at least 1 character.

The HTML form can be found in line 94, with the ID `credform`. It is
encapsulated by a `<div>` tag bearing the ID `formdiv`.

The button **Check Credentials** has an `onclick` event that calls the
Javascript function `checkCreds()`. Let's take a look at this function that is
defined on line 132.

The function performs some very simple checks.

1. Username should equal "Admin".
2. Password after using `atob()` function should equal "goldenticket".

> The Javascript `atob()` function stands for ASCII-to-binary, which is a base64
> decoder.

So the expected password would be the base64-encoded version of "goldenticket".
There are many ways to do so. Without overcomplicating too much, the most
straightforward way is to use Javascript's `btoa()` function within the
browser's developer mode.

```Javascript
btoa("goldenticket")
```

And we get the result `Z29sZGVudGlja2V0`. By supplying this as the password, we
get the following screen, with the flag **`enter_the_funhouse@flare-on.com`**.
