# Introduction

Following the same writing style as [Flare-On 2014 Challenge 1][f01c01], in
which I will attempt to explain my thought process in tackling this challenge.
With this, I hope this will benefit absolute beginners to reverse engineering.

# Recon

The challenge is a JAR file `MinesweeperChampionshipRegistration.jar`, which is
a Java Archive file. In that case, we can use a Java decompiler, such as
[JADX][jadx].

# Environment

Since it is a Java challenge, then of course, a Java Runtime Environment is
needed. The JAR file can be executed with the command 
`java -jar ./MinesweeperChampionshipRegistration.jar`. This gives the following
window:

# Reversing

This is a very trivial exercise. As soon as the JAR file is loaded into JADX,
the flag `GoldenTicket2018@flare-on.com` would be staring at our face already.

After putting this flag in the input window, we get the 'success' screen.
