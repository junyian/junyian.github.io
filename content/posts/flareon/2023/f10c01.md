## Introduction

This is Flare-On's 10th edition, and the first challenge is called _X_. With that
being said, Mandiant (or now a Google company), have declared that this edition
is the hardest one in Flare-On's history. However, the first challenge is, by far,
the easiest one I've seen.

## Recon

Upon extraction of the challenge file, many files were extracted. Two of the extracted
files stood out: `X.exe` and `X.dll`. We can start by assuming these 2 files are
the core of this challenge. Using [Detect-It-Easy][die] on both files:

- `X.exe` is written in C++. Library is .NET Core (Loader).
- `X.dll` is written in C#. Library is .NET Core.

From this, we can infer that `X.exe` is a .NET loader for `X.dll`.

The next typical recon step is to extract strings from the binaries. I have recently
discovered [FLOSS][floss], which is a great tool for extracting strings from binaries.
FLOSS stands for FLARE Obfuscated String Solver, which extracts static _and_ obfuscated
strings from binaries. Do visit their Github page for more information about what
else the tool can do.

The output of FLOSS for `X.exe` doesn't give much. But with `X.dll`, this came up!

And there you go, the flag **`glorified_captcha@flare-on.com`** is displayed.

But let's not stop here. We should still try to learn more about the challenge.

## Environment

The executable runs perfectly well on my Windows 11 VM. We are greeted with the
following GUI.

It looks like a 2-digit lock code, with an unlock button. When putting in a random
number, the `X` on the circuit board turns red.

## Reversing

Since it is just a 2 digit number, we could easily bruteforce it manually.
And the correct code is `42`, which displays the flag.

## Extras

Let's try to understand the challenge a bit more. The objectives this time are to:

- Find out how the input is evaluated.
- How the correct flag is displayed.

From the Introduction, we have deduced that `X.exe` is just a .NET loader for `X.dll`.
When looking at the disassembly of `X.exe`, it doesn't look like any typical
application.

So lets put focus on `X.dll` instead. Remember that the DLL is written in C#, so
we can use [dnSpyEx][dnspyex] to decompile the binary, and get the following.

![dll_decompiled](./flareon2023c01_img05.png)

The DLL have a namespace called `monogame1`, which contains a few classes. The
only class that is of interest is `Game1`. Within the class, we can find the
`Initialize` method, which prepares the GUI.

On line 30, we can see the code that initializes the lock button. It assigns the
method `_lockButton_click` to it.

And there you have it! The method `_lockButton_click` is where the magic happens.
It compares the displayed digit to the hardcoded value of 42. If it matches, the
flag is displayed using a MessageBox.
