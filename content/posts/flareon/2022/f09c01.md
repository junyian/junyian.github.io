## Introduction

The challenge is called _flaredle_ and consists of a HTML file `index.html`,
accompanied with `script.js`, `style.css`, and `word.js`.

## Environment

The environment in this case is a bit tricky. Supposedly, using a browser
should be enough. But if one loads `index.html` directly into a browser, the
page doesn't seem to allow anything to happen. By drilling down into the developer
mode of the browser (I'm using Chrome in this case), we can see the error message
`Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data,
isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.`.

A solution I found with some Google-fu, is starting Chrome with
`--allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security`.

Or we could be lazy just do a simple static analysis of the source code and
find the solution.

## Reversing

We're first greeted with the following interface.

When looking into the source code of `index.html`, the reference to `script.js` can
be seen on line 65. Let's look into this file next.

The first few lines of `script.js` is already interesting enough.

```javascript
import { WORDS } from "./words.js";

const NUMBER_OF_GUESSES = 6;
const WORD_LENGTH = 21;
const CORRECT_GUESS = 57;
let guessesRemaining = NUMBER_OF_GUESSES;
let currentGuess = [];
let nextLetter = 0;
let rightGuessString = WORDS[CORRECT_GUESS];
```

We can guess that the variable `rightGuessString` will hold the correct flag.
To double confirm this, we can see this variable being appended with
`@flare-on.com` on line 110. This variable is constructed using `WORDS[CORRECT_GUESS]`.
`WORDS` is imported from the file `words.js`, while `CORRECT_GUESS`is a hardcoded
value of`57`.

Now we look into `words.js`, and find the 58th element (because the first element
starts with 0), which happens to be on line 58. Hence the flag is
**`flareonisallaboutcats@flare-on.com`**.

If the challenge is loaded in Chrome using the command line options mentioned
above, we can use the flag and get the following results.
