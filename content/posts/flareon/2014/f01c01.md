## Introduction

I suppose that if someone is reading this in detail, the reader might be a total
beginner. So I'll try to be as comprehensive as possible to explain my thought
process - which I think is more important than the solution itself. It may not
be perfect or the fastest, but that just shows how one can be creative in
solving reversing challenges.

## Recon

My typical first step before starting any reverse engineering task, is to find
out more about the binary before dissecting it. I like to use [Detect-It-Easy
(DIE)][die] to get some basic information of the binary first. With it, we can
tell that the binary is a PE32 .NET executable.

Knowing this, we can immediately form in our mind what sort of tools we'll need.
My personal favourite tool for .NET reversing is [dnSpy][dnspy] since it can
function as a decompiler and a debugger for .NET binaries.

Typically, I would also look at strings found in the binary, though normally
this doesn't do much in harder challenges. But a good habit nevertheles. DIE has
a string feature that's useful for that, and we can find interesting strings
such as:

```text
Offset (hex): String
00000906:     dat_secret
0001c298:     btnDecode_Click
0001c3d1:     get_dat_secret
0001c406:     dat_secret
0001ca5e:     btnDecode
0001ca72:     DECODE!
0001cb60:     dat_secret
```

I would normally run a Signature check as well. But that doesn't show anything
useful in this case.

## Environment

Since I attempted a 2014 challenge in 2021, I imagine that the environment makes
a huge difference. The initial challenge was, of course, to make the binaries
run properly in my virtual machine that's based on Windows 10.

Upon running the EXE, Windows prompted to download and install .NET Framework
3.5. Thankfully, the EXE ran successfully to get this screen.

Clicking on the "DECODE!" button changes the screen that shows some gibberish at
the top, and swaps Bob's face with a dog.

## Reversing

I made the assumption that the gibberish text needs to be decoded. So we begin
by figuring out what happens when the button "DECODE!" is clicked.

After loading the EXE in dnSpy and exploring the decompiled output, the method
`Form1.btnDecode_Click()` can be found easily. We can then place a breakpoint at
the start of the method and begin tracing the code. The following actions can be
observed:

1. Load `Resources.dat_secret` to `byte[] dat_secret`.
2. Perform an algorithm to each byte of `dat_secret`, and append to variable
   `text`.
3. Terminate `text` with \0, or null terminator.
   The final value of `text` is **`3rmahg3rd.b0b.d0ge@flare-on.com`**, which is the
   flag for Challenge 1.

## Extras

### Displaying the flag

Further studying of the code after the forming `text`
This isn't strictly necessary, but if we wanted the EXE to display the flag on
the final screen, the obvious way is to patch the binary to display `text`
instead of `text3` as what's being done in `btnDecode_Click()`. This can be done
easily using dnSpy.

### Coding practice

As a form of coding practice, we could also try to implement the algorithm in
any chosen language. `Resources.dat_secret` can be saved to disk from dnSpy,
identified as `rev_challenge_1.dat_secret.encode`.

```python
# Written with Python 3.10.0
with open('rev_challenge_1.dat_secret.encode','rb') as file:
    text = ''
    for b in file.read():
        text += chr((b >> 4 | b << 4 & 240) ^ 41)
    print(text)
```
