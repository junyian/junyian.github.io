My PC crashed some time ago, and I had to reinstall everything. At the same,
work load just gotten a lot heavier for the past 2 years so I never found
the time to properly set up my workstation again.

I was also kind-of lazy to set up Jekyll from scratch, and started to look for
alternatives which is not as time consuming. Then I was introduced to 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which seemed like it didn't require as much maintenance.

So, this is the reboot of my blog. I'm still trying to learn how to configure
Hugo to set up the page the way I want. Then I'll slowly port over the posts 
from my previous blog and include write ups for the more recent 
[Flare-On](https://flare-on.com) challenges. I'm also taking this opportunity
to review my previous posts and fix the scripts that's no longer working too,
while learning how to use Hugo and this template.
