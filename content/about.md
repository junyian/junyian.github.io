Dad of 2 very cheeky girls and husband to a very lovely wife.
Just a normal, regular guy with far too many interests. Including but not
limited to (in no particular order):

- Coding (a little bit of everything: x86/x64 assembly, Python, Golang,
  Javascript, Rust, etc.)
- Reverse engineering
- Mobile technology (my day job revolves around this, so no, I don't code nor
  reverse engineer for a living)
- Machine learning
- Rock climbing (keep the kids away from devices!)
- Waze map editor
- Chess
- Food!!!
- Travelling

I'm no expert in any of the topics, but... I love sharing :) So if this mini-page
of mine helps anyone in any way, thumbs up to you!
