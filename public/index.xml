      <description>My PC crashed some time ago, and I had to reinstall everything. At the same, work load just gotten a lot heavier for the past 2 years so I never found the time to properly set up my workstation again.
I was also kind-of lazy to set up Jekyll from scratch, and started to look for alternatives which is not as time consuming. Then I was introduced to Hugo, which seemed like it didn&amp;rsquo;t require as much maintenance.</description>
