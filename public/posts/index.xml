      <description>The last month of 2023 was one hell of a ride. Many things happened all at once.&#xA;For starters, I was laid off from my role which I held for almost 9 years. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little out of it, reflecting on what I would like to do next. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the telecoms industry for about 20 years. Mainly focused on mobile networks rollout and optimization since 3G (WCDMA) days.</description>

      <description>Reboot My PC crashed some time ago, and I had to reinstall everything. At the same, work load just gotten a lot heavier for the past 2 years so I never found the time to properly set up my workstation again.&#xA;I was also kind-of lazy to set up Jekyll again, and started to look for alternatives. Then I was introduced to Hugo, which seemed like it didn&amp;rsquo;t require as much maintenance as Jekyll.</description>
